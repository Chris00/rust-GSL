# rust-GSL

A __Rust__ binding for the [GSL library][GSL library] (the GNU Scientific Library).

The minimum support Rust version is __1.54__.

## Installation

This binding requires the [GSL library] library (version >= 2) to be installed:

### Linux

```bash
# on debian based systems:
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install gsl
```

#### Apple silicon

Homebrew installs libraries under `/opt/homebrew/include` on Apple silicon
to [maintain backward compatibility with Rosetta 2](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-is-the-default-installation-prefix-opthomebrew-on-apple-silicon). 

After `gsl` has been installed in the usual way, use
the [environment variable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html):

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-L /opt/homebrew/include'
```

before `cargo run`, `cargo build`, etc., to tell the compiler where `gsl` is located.

### Windows

Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) and then the GSL:

```bash
vcpkg install gsl --triplet=x64-windows-static-md
```

## Usage

This crate works with Cargo and is on [crates.io]. Just add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
GSL = "7.0"
```

You can see examples in the `examples` folder.

## Building

To build `rgsl`, just run `cargo build`. However, if you want to use a specific version, you'll
need to use the `cargo` features. For example:

```bash
cargo build --features v2_1
```

If a project depends on this version, don't forget to add in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.GSL]
version = "2"
features = ["v2_1"]
```

## Documentation

You can access the __rgsl__ documentation locally, just build it:

```shell
> cargo doc --open
```

You can also access the latest build of the documentation via the internet [here](https://docs.rs/crate/GSL/).

__rust-GSL__ is a wrapper for __GSL__, therefore inherits the [GPL license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
